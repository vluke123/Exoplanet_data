Aim is to create a working 'app' that can take various attributes of an exoplanet and produce graphs based on the XML data. Currently the script:

- Takes all XML data for each planet
- Creates a pandas DataFrame which is then cleans
- Nulls are dropped from the df.
- Scatter graph plotted with a trendline calcualted by Least Squares regression.
- Produces the following graph:
